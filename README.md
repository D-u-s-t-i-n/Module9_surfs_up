# Challenge Notes
Oahu has very stable climate throughout the year, based on June and December comparisons. The mean temperatures are 74.94 and 71.04 (June & December respectively), min temperatures are 64 and 56, and max temperatures 85 and 83. Precipitation min and lower 25% quartile remains at 0 for both June and December seasons. The mean (0.136 vs 0.217) and max (4.43 vs 6.42) precipitation are slightly different, but the mean temperature shows there is enough heat and dryness for a good ice cream sale.  

## Recommendations
- Datasets for other regions (not Oahu) would help for comparison
- Additional matlab plotting temperature vs time (each x-tick would be year) to highlight consistency across decade
- Additional matlab plotting precipitation vs time to see how much of an impact the 2013 Thailand flood or other monsoons may have had impact in the Oahu area
